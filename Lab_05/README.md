# ASSIGNMENT 5
# Description
Define a class Fraction with a constructor (taking two parameters: numerator and denominator), arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), comparison operators, and both string conversions (the result should be in the form numerator/denominator). 
Ensure that the arithmetic operations do not modify their arguments. Add error handling for attempts to create a fraction with a zero denominator (assert). Pay attention to the correct handling of negative fractions as well as fractions with a value of zero. 
Fractions should be stored in reduced form (you can use math.gcd for this purpose, as it provides a non-negative result even for negative arguments). Write test code for your solution, testing at least two fractions. You may assume that the second argument for operators is also a fraction.
